- Should "Type 'commands' to view a list of available commands" really be shown to new users in the first lesson?
- Catch Ctrl-D for quitting?
- Until the history scrolling/buffer has not been explained, clear screen before each step to reduce visual clutter?
- Sometimes input seems to get eaten... Like, I would type 'n' but it doesn't appear...
- Mouse scrolling doesn't work in my terminal (gnome-terminal), so it's hard to for example see the weather report.
- Maybe use C++ compiler instead of Go in lesson2 because everyone's heard of C++? Even better if it would be a command they can try out immediately. Or maybe skip the discussion of subcommands alltogether because they're really just arguments?
- British spelling intentional?
- Maybe .hiddenfile.txt should exist so it shows up in ls -a in lesson3?
- In lesson3, the user could navigate to / (cd ..; cd ..; cd ..;) and then mkdir will fail. Reset the CWD for that step? Other solutions?
- cd auto-completion is a bit weird, e.g. cd / then cd home<TAB> completes 'cd home ' with a space at the end instead of the expected 'cd home/'
- rmdir and rm don't auto-complete?
- lesson4 2/6 says "this isn't quite right" when doing ls -a which is a bit counter-intuitive
